Language Feature Documentation for Fill.ai

This document explains how the new multilingual functionality works.
"""

# Language Selection Process:
"""
1. Upon instantiation, the WebSocketSpeechFormFiller asks the user to select their language:
   - English (Default)
   - Ukrainian 
   - Amharic

2. User can respond by saying:
   - The number (1, 2, or 3)
   - The language name in English
   - The language name in their native language

3. The system confirms the selection and proceeds with the conversation in that language.
"""

# Translation Workflow:
"""
1. QUESTIONS: Asked in user's preferred language
   - English question: "What is your full name?"
   - Ukrainian question: "–Ø–∫ –≤–∞—Å –∑–≤–∞—Ç–∏ –ø–æ–≤–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—é?"
   - Amharic question: "·àô·àâ ·àµ·àù·ãé ·àù·äï·ãµ·äï ·äê·ãç?"

2. USER RESPONSES: Given in their preferred language
   - Ukrainian response: "–Ü–≤–∞–Ω –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ"
   - Amharic response: "·ä†·â†·â† ·â∞·àµ·çã·ã¨"

3. FORM FILLING: Responses automatically translated to English
   - Form field gets: "Ivan Petrenko" or "Abebe Tesfaye"
   - This ensures form compatibility while providing native language support
"""

# Code Usage Examples:
"""
# Method 1: Programmatic language setting (for web interfaces)
form_filler = WebSocketSpeechFormFiller()
form_filler.set_user_language('ukrainian')

# Method 2: Interactive language selection (for voice interfaces)
form_filler = WebSocketSpeechFormFiller()
# Language selection happens automatically in start_conversation()

# Method 3: Pre-set language in initialization
form_filler = WebSocketSpeechFormFiller()
form_filler.user_language = 'amharic'
"""

# Available Methods:
"""
- select_language(): Interactive language selection via speech
- set_user_language(language): Programmatic language setting
- translate_text(text, from_lang, to_lang): General translation method
- speak_in_user_language(text): Speak text in user's preferred language
- translate_user_response_to_english(response): Convert user input to English
"""

# Benefits:
"""
1. ACCESSIBILITY: Supports users who don't speak English fluently
2. ACCURACY: Users can express themselves clearly in their native language
3. COMPATIBILITY: Form data remains in English for processing/storage
4. FLEXIBILITY: Supports both voice and programmatic language selection
5. SCALABILITY: Easy to add more languages by updating the available_languages dict
